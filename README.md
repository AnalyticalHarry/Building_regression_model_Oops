# Building Regression Model using OOPs 

Hey Quant Analyst 📊, Data Scientist 🧠and Dev 💻 .
Well, I just managed to build a Machine Learning Model using object Oriented Programming in python. 😎 I also validated my personal design model and finding using scikit-learn. 🤖 Our dependent variable is Tesla and Independent variable is SNP500 index. I used pattern identification, data comparison of coefficient and interception between my design model and Linear Regression Model from sklearn. Hopefully, you guys enjoy this report and let me know any question on comment section or inbox.
